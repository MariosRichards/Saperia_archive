bit.ly/organizecivictech,Civic Tech Field Guide,Google sheet as directory,"We put this sheet together to try to organize the civic tech field by compiling hundreds of civic technologies and grouping them to see what patterns emerge. We started doing this because we think that a widely-used definition and field guide would help us: share knowledge with one another, attract more participation in the field, study and measure impact, and move resources in productive directions. For us, this work is a prerequisite to developing a framework to conduct research within, and we'd love input to help improve it. We didn't produce a taxonomy because so many of these tools and social processes are overlapping: our categories are not mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive.
